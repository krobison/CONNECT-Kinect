		<b><u>CS Connect News</b></u>
		<br>
		Congratulations to Amos Gwa, who posted the winning comment on the first CS Question! He will receive a Mines CS t-shirt. This t-shirt will be the prize for the best answer to the CS Question moving forward. In case you haven't heard, the t-shirt features a Perl script that prints the school fight song (and is generally awesome and also soft). Check out the t-shirt <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103513341/DeployedThings/shirt.html" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" >here</a>.

		There will be a couple other ways to win nifty CS things for participating on the CS Connect site: <br>
		1) The author of the post that receives the most upvotes every week will receive some Mines swag. <br>
		2) Some of the top contributors to the site will be given the opportunity to have free lunch with some industry representatives (there may be some room to choose the company). These will be chosen sometime in late March/early April.
		You can track site contributors at <a href="http://connect.mines.edu/cs_connect" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" >http://connect.mines.edu/cs_connect</a>.
